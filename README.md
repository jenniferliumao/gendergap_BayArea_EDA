# Is the gap gradually eliminated in tech industry?
## Abstract
In the past decades, many efforts have been done to close the gender pay gap. The female-to-male earnings ratio increased significantly from 0.6 in 1960 to 0.8 in 2017. As data science students in San Francisco, we are curious about the wage gap in SF Bay Area, especially for tech industry. Although the gender pay gap in San Francisco Bay Area is slightly better than the United States as a whole, Santa Clara County, as the center of tech companies, has the largest gender pay gap in the Bay Area and women make up only very small percentage among the workers in tech industry; tech companies in San Francisco Bay Area still need to go a long way towards overcoming the gender inequality.

## Dataset
The datasets we used come from the United States Census Bureau and American Community Survey. 

It contains the following information:
  - Yearly female/male median earning from 1960 to 2017
  - Employed population by gender and occupation of United States, State of California, Counties of San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara.

of United States, State of California, Counties of San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara.

### So, now, let’s start our topic!

## Does male and female get the equal pay?
IN 2017, the median earning of male was 10k more than female, for full-time employee in US.

Let’s have a look at the yearly median Earning of male and female From 1960 to 2017.

It seems male always  earn more than female in the past 60 years, but it seems that the gap between them are more and more closed.

So we have the data for earning ratio.

The earning ratio is the ratio between female median earning and male median earning.

From 1960 to 2017, this ratio increase from 60% to 80%.

Such a large increase!

Does it mean the gender gap is closing? In particular, what’s the situation  in tech industry in San Francisco Bay Area?

## Situation in tech industry in San Francisco Bay Area
We investigated the earning ratio in 2017 for computer enignnering and science occupations in  three main counties in bay area: San Francisco County, mainly the SF city, San Mateo County, roughly from daly city to palo alto standford, and Santa Clara County, including mountain view to san jose.

From this graph, we can see that the earning ratio for tech occupations in CA and Bay Area, are all slightly higher compared with the national earning ratio of 80% 2017.

However, when we include all occupations, we see a dramatic drop in the ratio for Santa Clara County. In particular, it’s earning ratio is 72% in 2017, equivalent to the national level in 1994.

Is it suprise for you? As main part of silicon valley, so many famous tech companies loacted in Santa Clara County, such as Google, Linkedin, Apple. We know that larger tech companies always claim that they made many efforts on closing the gender gap.

## Why Santa Clara has the largest gender pay gap in SF Bay Area?
From the earning distribution in Santa Clara County, we can see that the women with highest income are those work with computer engineering and science occupations.

Santa Clara County had the most population of employees in computer, engineering, and science.

However, women made up only 22% of the population in that highly paid sector.

This indicate that although female in tech companies are paid similar to male, it is very hard for women to enter this highly paid fields.

Furthermore, after we include the data for part time jobs together with full- time jobs, we further see a large drop in the earning ratio.

The possible reason can be that female take more responsibility of raising children for a falimity, so they have no energy and time for a full time job.

## Conclusions
- Santa Clara County, as the center of tech companies, has the largest gender pay gap in the Bay Area.

- Women make up only very small percentage among the employed population in tech industry.

- Tech companies in San Francisco Bay Area still need to go a long way towards overcoming the gender inequality.

**Although women got paid not much less than men in tech industry, it is very difficult for women to get full-time offers in highly paid companies.There is still a long way towards eliminating the gender inequality among tech industry in SF.**
