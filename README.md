# Is the gap gradually eliminated in tech industry?
## ABSTRACT
Although the gender pay gap in San Francisco Bay Area is slightly better than
the United States as a whole, Santa Clara County, as the center of tech com-
panies, has the largest gender pay gap in the Bay Area and women make up
only very small percentage among the workers in tech industry; tech companies
in San Francisco Bay Area still need to go a long way towards overcoming the
gender inequality.
